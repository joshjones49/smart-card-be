# Currently being used with the SmartCard app

Right now only has one table that contains flashcards that have a question, answer and category
Later down the line I plan to add a user and userCards along with some Authentication and Authorization so that only users can create and delete their own cards
App only supports Creation and Reading at the moment but other basic CRUD functionality is being worked on
